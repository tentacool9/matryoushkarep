# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) vs. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) CNN: Comparative Analysis On MNIST

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that compares a native CNN and an MRL-CNN across 50 experiments, analyzing performance, robustness, and interpretability.

## Overview

*Accuracy/loss metrics on MNIST/CIFAR-10.
*Class-wise cosine similarity of embeddings.
*Grad-CAM feature importance maps.
*Robustness against MNIST-C corruptions.
*Eigenvalue distributions of linear layers.
